# Conncheck

A web page for checking connectivity status from inside your browser.

It includes a live HTTP ping.

## Requirements

PHP is required for displaying the client IP, timestamp and for writing no-cache headers. You could remove this functionality from the source code and change the file extension to `html` to serve the page without PHP.

Node.js is required for Javascript dependencies (please see below).

## Installing

Upload it to the www folder, then run the following to install javascript dependencies:

```
npm install
```
